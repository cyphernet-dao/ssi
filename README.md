# Self-sovereign identity suite

Self-sovereign identity is an identity format developed by Cyphernet
Association, Switzerland. Being similar to OpenPGP, it operates without
any key servers, using blockchain infrastructure. This allows provable and
globally enforceable key revocation without dedicated revocation keys,
global propagation of new keys information and provable or unique
signatures which are timestamped or created using single-use-seal
mechanism.
